                TS2 68000 Computer Theory Of Operation
                ======================================

This is based on the "Design Example Using the 68000" section of the
book "Microprocessor Systems Design 68000 Hardware, Software, and
Interfacing", third edition, by Alan Clements. It has been adjusted to
reflect my modified design. Refer to the schematic diagram when
reading the following sections.

Specifications of the TS2
-------------------------

1. The TS2 uses a 68000 CPU.

2. It is built on a single circuit board.

3. The CPU card is capable of operating on its own. System testing is
   thus facilitated because other modules are not required to operate
   the CPU card in a stand-alone mode.

4. The original TS2 provided an external bus. This was omitted in my
   design as it was not required and reduced the chip count
   considerably.

5. The memory on the CPU card is static RAM and EPROM/EEPROM to avoid
   the complexity and associated difficulty of debugging dynamic RAM
   circuitry.

6. Full seven-level interrupt facilities are provided, but are
   optional. If included, these can support a level 7 interrupt
   (abort) switch, interrupts from the two ACIAs, and external
   interrupts.

7. Full address decoding is provided. The address space is compatible
   with the Motorola MEX68KECB Educational Computer Board (ECB)
   development system in order to facilitate the transfer of software
   between the TS2 and ECB.

8. The vector table at $00000000 to $000003FF is implemented in RAM,
   with the exception of the reset vectors which are mapped to the
   first 8 bytes of ROM (this is described in more detail later).

9. The RAM is implemented by 8Kx8 CMOS devices to minimize the
    component count.

10. The ROM is implemented by 2764 type 8Kx8 EPROMs or 2864 type 8Kx8
    EEPROMs (or equivalent CMOS devices).

11. The terminal (console) interface is through a serial port. A
    secondary port is also provided. Configuration is the same as in
    the ECB development system.

12. The module's local address and data buses have not been buffered
    as the CPU has adequate fanout.

Top Level Schematic (schematic page 1)
--------------------------------------

Each IC has a 0.1 uF ceramic bypass capacitor across the Vcc and GND
pins. A single 100 uF capacitor provides additional power supply
filtering. It requires a +5 volt supply. A switch controls power and a
green LED (D2) indicates power on.

The majority of chips are 7400 series LS family TTL devices. There are
a few spare gates. Their inputs are grounded as per standard TTL
design practice.

Reset, Halt, and Clock Control Circuits (schematic page 2)
----------------------------------------------------------

Every CPU requires a certain amount of basic control circuitry to
enable it to operate -- this circuitry includes its clock, reset,
halt, and similar functions. Such circuitry can be designed largely
independently of the rest of the system and is needed to perform even
the simplest tests on the CPU. Therefore, we will design these
circuits first.

Page 2 gives the diagram of the control circuitry surrounding the
68000, excluding the interrupt request inputs. The control of HALT*
and RESET* is conventional. At power-on, a 555 timer configured as a
monostable, U1, generates a single active-high pulse.

Open-collector buffers, U4C and U4D, apply the reset pulse to the
68000's RESET* and HALT* inputs, respectively. A manual reset
generator is formed from two cross-coupled NAND gates, U3A and U3B,
and applied to the reset lines by a further two open-collector
buffers, U4A and U4B. An inverting buffer, U5A, gates the reset pulse
from U1 onto the system bus as the active-low POR* (Power On Reset).
This signal is used by other modules to clear circuits on power-up.

An LED, D1, is connected to the HALT* pin via a buffer. This LED is
fitted to the front panel and confirms the reset operation. It also
shows if the CPU has asserted HALT* because of a double bus fault.

The 68000 clock input is provided by an 8 MHz crystal-controlled clock
in a DIP package. If desired, a lower speed clock oscillator can be
used either for test purposes or to allow using a lower-speed 68000
chip.

The high impedance control circuits show on page 1 are pulled up to
the Vcc by resistors. Although pullup resistors are necessary on BR*,
DTACK*, etc., the reader may be surprised to find them on AS*, UDS*,
LDS*, and R/W*. They are required here because these pins are driven
by tristate outputs in the 68000. When the 68000 relinquishes the bus
all tristate lines are floated. To leave the state of these bus lines
undefined is unwise, as a spurious bus cycle might possibly be
generated in certain circumstances. A better course is to be safe
rather than sorry. During the testing phase, some of the pullup
resistors were temporary and used only for testing purposes, because
they were connected to lines that will later be pulled up or down by
totem-pole outputs. They appear so that the circuit can be tested
independently of the rest of the system.

Testing the CPU control circuitry is very easy. The power on reset
circuit is tested by attaching an oscilloscope probe to test point 1
(TP1), switching on the Vcc power supply, and observing the
positive-going pulse. A negative-going pulse should be observed at the
CPU's RESET* and HALT* pins. The manual reset pulse generator should
force HALT* and RESET* low whenever the reset button is pushed.

An 8 MHz square wave should be observed at the CLK input to the CPU.
All inputs pulled up to a logical 1 should be at a logical 1 state.

The next step is to install the 68000 and force the CPU to free-run.
As no memory components have yet been fitted, the CPU must be fooled
into thinking that it is executing valid bus cycles. To do this,
DTACK* is temporarily connected to the AS* output. Whenever the 68000
starts a memory access by asserting AS*, DTACK* is automatically
asserted to complete the cycle.

The 68000 is a trick beasty to test in a free-running mode, because it
generates an exception if a nonvalid op-code is detected. Should the
68000 then generate a second exception, the resulting bus fault will
cause it to halt. Therefore, the 68000 must always see a valid op-code
on its data bus. One way of doing this is to pull up (or down) the
data bus lines with resistors to Vcc (or ground). Traditionally, CPUs
are tested by placing a NOP (no operation) op-code on the data bus.
The 68000 NOP code is $4E71 (i.e. %0100 1110 0111 0001). If this code
is jammed onto the data bus, the 68000 will also use it for the stack
pointer and reset vectors during the exception processing. Sadly, this
code will lead to an address error. When the CPU reads the stack
pointer from addresses $00000000 and $00000002 at the start of its
reset exception processing, it obtains $4E714E71. Unfortunately this
value is odd and generates an address exception. We need to use a
dummy op-code that is even to allow the CPU to free-run. One suitable
opcode is $0000 which corresponds to the instruction ORI.B #0,D0.

When a suitable op-code has been jammed into D00 to D15, the 68000
should free-run and a square wave observed on address pins A01 to A23.
The frequency at pin Ai should be one half of that at Ai-1.

Address Decoding (schematic page 3)
-----------------------------------

The specification for the TS2 CPU module calls for up to 32 Kbytes of
static RAM and up to 32 Kbytes of EPROM at the bottom of the
processors 16-MByte address space, permitting up to eight
memory-mapped components, each occupying 64 bytes. The table below
gives the memory map of the TS2 CPU module.

A five-input NOR gate, U24A, generates an active-high output whenever
A19 to A23 are all low. Together with A18 and A17, this gate enables a
three line to eight line decoder, U26, that divides the lower 128
KBytes of memory space from $00000000 to $0001FFFF into eight blocks
of 16K. The first four blocks decode the address space for the
read/write memory and ROM. We deal with the selection of the reset
vector memory space in ROM later.

The active-low peripherals group select output of U26 (i.e. the
address range $00010000 to $00013FFF) enabled a second three line to
eight line decoder, U27. U27 is a 25LS2548 that has two active-low and
two active-high enable inputs. It also has an active-low
open-collector output, ACK*, that is asserted whenever the device is
enabled and strobed by a negative going oulse on its RD* or WR*
inputs.

U27 is also enabled by U24B, which is high when A09 to A13 are all
low, and by AS* from the CPU. Thus, whenever a valid address in the
range $00010000 to $000101FF appears on the address bus, one of U27's
active-low outputs is asserted, indicating a synchronous access to a
peripheral by asserting the processor's VPA* input. Note that this
arrangement is intended to be used in conjunction with 6800-series
peripherals.

An access to the reset vectors in the range $00000000 to $00000007 is
detected by gates U24A, U25A, U24B, U25B, U10C, and U19B. When the
output of each NOR gate is high, signifying a zero on A03 to A23, the
output of the NAND gate U19B, RV*, goes active-low. That is, RV* is
low whenever a reset vector is being accessed and is used to overlay
the exception table in read/write memory with the reset vectors in
ROM.

The address decoder on page 3 can be tested to a limit extent by
free-running the CPU and detecting decoding pulses at the outputs of
the address decoder. A better technique is to insert a test ROM and to
execute an infinite loop which periodically accesses the reset vector
space. This makes it easy to observe the operation of the circuit with
an oscilloscope.

ACIAs  (schematic page 8)
-------------------------

Omitted serial port echo feature of the original TS2.

Implemented using FTDI connector for USB to serial rather than true
RS-232 which would require the connected computer to have RS-232
serial ports.

Optionally it can be powered by USB using either of the FTDI serial
ports - a jumper needs to be connected to to the port where power is
taken from, in which case an external power supply should not be used.

Interrupt Control Circuitry  (schematic page 9)
-----------------------------------------------

To be determined. This circuitry is currently incomplete and untested.

Design Notes
------------

The prototype was wirewrapped on a phenolic board with 0.1" holes 6 by
9 inches in size.

Sockets were used for all ICs and most discrete components.

5 volt power connects to two binding posts. Optionally it can be
powered by USB. Current consumption is approximately 600 mA will all
ICs installed.

Possible Future Enhancements
----------------------------

Ideas for a possible rev 2.x:

Printed circuit board.
Replace baud rate generator with fixed clock oscillator/counter.
Add one or two PIA, VIA, or PIT chips.
Add some connectors for external parallel i/o, interrupts, etc.
Use more common chip(s) in place of 25LS248
On-board 5 volt regulator/buck converter.
Support higher baud rates (through jumpers or software).
Add a seven segment LED display for diagnostics?
Prototype area?
Support either RAM or EPROM/EEPROM in all sockets.
Support larger RAM and ROM chips (e.g. 27128, 27256, etc. Impacts memory map).
