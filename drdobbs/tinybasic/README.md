This is Gordon Brandly's version of Tiny BASIC for the 68000.

This version has been modified slightly to assemble with the VASM
assembler. The original files, documentation, and examples can be
found in the "original" directory.

It can be built to run out of RAM (start address $900) or ROM (start
address $C000). See the comments in the source code and Makefile.
