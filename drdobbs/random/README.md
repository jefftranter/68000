This is the source for "A Pseudo Random-Number Generator" by Michaal
P. McLaughlin from Dr. Dobb's Toolbook of 68000 Programming.

It has been modified slightly to compile with the VASM assembler.

Original description: "The pseudo randon-number generator routine
presented below uses an algorithm commonly known as "GGUBS." This is a
good algorithm with a very long period."
