This directory has patches to newlib to build a version that runs on
the TS2 68000 single board computer.

The script build.sh will download, build and install a suitable
cross-compiler version of gcc and then build and install newlib.

The i/o routines for the TS2 use the TUTOR monitor trap 14 functions.

Control returns, via _exit(), to the TUTOR monitor.

The only i/o functions supported are standard input and output which
use the console serial port.

The program, data, heap, and stack cannot exceed the 32K of available
memory (actually 30K as the first 2K are used by exception vectors and
TUTOR).

Floating point math is supported, but done in software and will
therefore be slow and generate a lot of code. The smaller version of
printf() in newlib is used which does not support printing floating
point values.

Known issues:

Most newlib functions have not been tested. Only a few very small,
simple C programs have been tried. See the parent directory for
an example.

The exit() routine was crashing due to an issue with the atexit
handlers. It appears that the code generated by this version of gcc is
not compatible with the newlib implementation. I've worked around this
by not calling exit, and directly calling _exit() after main() is
executed.
