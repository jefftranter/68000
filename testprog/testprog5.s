* Example of interrupt-driven I/O.
* Reads characters from console (serial port) and stores in a buffer.
* Main program runs busy wait loop.
* Returns to Tutor monitor when carriage return character is received.

TUTOR   EQU     228                     TRAP 14 function to return to monitor
AV5     EQU     $00000074               Interrupt vector for console UART (IRQ5 autovector)
ACIA1   EQU     $00010040               Console ACIA base address
CR      EQU     $0D                     Carriage return

* Main Program

        ORG     $2000                   Locate in RAM

START   CLR.B   POS                     Initialize buffer position to zero
        CLR.B   EXIT                    Initialize exit flag to false

        LEA.L   HANDLER,A0              Get address of interrupt handler
        MOVE.L  A0,AV5                  Write to interrupt vector

        LEA.L   ACIA1,A0                A0 points to console ACIA
        MOVE.B  #$95,(A0)               Set up ACIA1 (RX IRQ, RTS low, 8N1, clock divide by 16)

        AND #%1111100011111111,SR       Set SR bits to all zeroes to enable all interrupts

* Perform endless busy loop until exit flag is set

        MOVE.B  #$15,(A0)               Set up ACIA1 constants (no IRQ, RTS low, 8N1, clock divide by 16)

        MOVE.B  #TUTOR,D7               Go to TUTOR function
        TRAP    #14                     Call TRAP14 handler
