This is a port of Lee Davison's Enhanced Basic for 68000 to my TS2
single board computer. 

It should be assembled using the VASM retargetable assembler. It can
be loaded into RAM and started from address $0800.

 EhBASIC68

 Enhanced BASIC is a BASIC interpreter for the 68k family microprocessors. It
 is constructed to be quick and powerful and easily ported between 68k systems.
 It requires few resources to run and includes instructions to facilitate easy
 low level handling of hardware devices. It also retains most of the powerful
 high level instructions from similar BASICs.
